msgstr "@silver [……这代表它可能侦测到了这间房间里的动态， 然后自己出现了。]"

msgid "@silver_eyeclosed [Probably even part of a robot, at one point.]"
msgstr "@silver_eyeclosed [也许它甚至曾经是机器人的零件也不一定。]"

msgid "@niko_what Oh..."
msgstr "@niko_what 喔……"

msgid "@silver_eyeclosed [...or not. I don't know.]"
msgstr "@silver_eyeclosed [……也可能不是，我也不清楚。]"
