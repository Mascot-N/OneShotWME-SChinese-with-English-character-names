msgid "@niko2 ...right."

msgstr "@rue 机器人的整个存在都是由程序代码构成。"

msgid "@rue_talk Inflexible programming, with thoughts dictated by someone else's design."

msgid "@rue ...And most importantly... they will never confuse themselves with the living."
msgstr "@rue ……最重要的是……机器人绝对不会把自己和生物混淆。"

msgid "@rue They will always be bound by their code, the knowledge that they are a robot."
msgstr "@rue 它们会永远受制于自身的程序代码，和身为机器人的认知。"

msgid "@rue ...but this was more of a limitation than anything else."
msgstr "@rue ……不过这应该偏向限制而不是别的。"

msgid "@niko_eyeclosed Ah, that makes sense."
msgstr "@niko_eyeclosed 啊，这样说有道理。"

msgid "@niko2 You can't... really build a robot to not follow its own code, can you?"
msgstr "@niko2 没有人会……做一个不遵照程序代码运作的机器人，对吧？"

msgid "@rue_sigh People have tried, but it's a recipe for disaster."
msgstr "@rue_sigh 有人试过，结果很惨烈。"

msgid "@rue_talk You can establish a special bond with it."
msgstr "@rue_talk 你还是能和机器人建立特别的关系。"

msgid "@rue If the strength of that bond is strong enough..."
msgstr "@rue 如果这份关系够坚定……"

msgid "@rue ...the robot's mental capacity will start to develop outside of its programming."
msgstr "@rue ……这个机器人的心智能力就会开始发展，超出它原本的程序编码。"

msgid "@rue_smile In a way, it's starting to believe itself as a \"real\", valid individual."
msgstr "@rue_smile 某方面来说，它会开始相信自己是“真的”、实际的个体。"

msgid "@niko ..."
msgstr "@niko ……"

msgid "@rue It's a complete suspension of disbelief on your end, though."
msgstr "@rue 但是你这边就必须完全放下你的怀疑。"

msgid "@rue_talk You have to fully embrace the robot as a genuine, living person, even knowing they are not..."

msgstr "@rue_sad 这个内容更新……牵涉到很深层的编码。"

msgid "@rue_talk My creator was able to access some of the source code, you know..."
msgstr "@rue_talk 你知道吗，我的创造者访问了一部分的源代码……"

msgstr "@rue 他尽力在不同的地图之间建造了新的连接。"

msgid "@rue_smile Those links enabled you to meet the other two."
msgstr "@rue_smile 这些连接让你得以遇到另外两位。"

msgid "@rue_sad But as it turns out, the new code confused the World Machine to such an extent that it's breaking down altogether."
msgstr "@rue_sad 可是结果，新的程序代码让世界机器混乱到崩溃了。"

msgid "@rue Even though the World Machine always had self-destructive tendencies, it usually restrains itself when you are in the world."
msgstr "@rue 虽然世界机器本来就有自我毁灭的倾向，但通常你在这个世界的时候它还会克制。"
